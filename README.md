# Predicting House Prices
Multiple linear regression model to predict house prices

This project uses multiple linear regression to predict the market price of cars. This project is based on the Dataquest mission 240 guided project where feature selection and engineering is used to train and test a multiple linear regression model to predict house sale prices. This project expands on the guided project by implementing parameter optimization to find the optimal number of k-folds when using k-fold cross validation to measure the regression model's accuracy.
